A syntax parser for the Swift language.
Its main task is to analyze the structure of a program written in Swift language according to the rules of that language's grammar.

How it works:

  Tokenization (Lexical Analysis): The parser first breaks down the source code into tokens, which are the smallest units of meaning in the language. These tokens can be keywords, identifiers, operators, punctuation, etc.

  Parsing (Syntactic Analysis): After tokenization, the parser analyzes the sequence of tokens to determine whether they form valid statements or expressions according to the syntax rules of the language.

  Error Handling: If the parser encounters syntax errors or other issues during the parsing process, it generates error messages to indicate the problem to the programmer.
